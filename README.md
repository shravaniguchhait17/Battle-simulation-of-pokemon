# Battle-simulation-of-pokemon
This game allows the user and the computer to choose between three starter pokemon “Charmander”, “Squirtle” and “Bulbasaur”.
Then it takes turns selecting moves to use against each other. Both Gary and Ash start at the same health “100”, and should be able to choose between the two moves and heal.
Then the health damage has different range and the amount of damage given and amount of damage received is random .
After each move, a label shows the health of Gary and Ash simultaneously after each attack. Once Ash or Gary's health reaches 0, the game will end.

When Gary’s health reaches less than 35, it increases his chance to cast heal.
Entry music plays at the start of the game. Battle music plays throughout the game.
